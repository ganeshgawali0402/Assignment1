In this given Assignment I have considered a hybrid framework which consist of Maven as Build Management tool.
Java as a programming language, Selenium for Web Automation, TestNg for unit testing framework.
Git for code management and Jenkins for continuous integration.
In this framework PageObject method and Page factory method is been considered.  
Each page has been prepared as Java class and has been stored under the package of page object.
The test-cases have been kept under the package name test cases.
All the test cases can be triggered through pom.xml  and testng.xml file.
